In this project several simple examples of using LibXIMC protocol with 8SMC5-USB controller were implemented. A rotating optical attenuator was used as a controlled device. Code samples were written on Python 3.4 and also in LabVIEW programming environment. Keep in mind that all examples imply presetting device using XILab and ".cfg" file, which is added to this project as well as all necessary LibXIMC files. Note that modification of folders with examples is not adviced.

Both LabVIEW and Python realizations include a simple linear and more complexed cyclical algorithms. You can launch Python files from cmd; LabVIEW examples can be run as separate VIs or as single ".lvproj" project/
